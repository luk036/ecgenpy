 Set Partition

 A set partition of the set [n] = {1,2,3,...,n} is a collection B0,
 B1, ... Bj of disjoint subsets of [n] whose union is [n]. Each Bj
 is called a block. Below we show the partitions of [4]. The periods
 separtate the individual sets so that, for example, 1.23.4 is the
 partition {{1},{2,3},{4}}.
   1 block:  1234
   2 blocks: 123.4   124.3   134.2   1.234   12.34   13.24   14.23
   3 blocks: 1.2.34  1.24.3  14.2.3  13.2.4  12.3.4
   4 blocks: 1.2.3.4

 Each partition above has its blocks listed in increasing order of
 smallest element; thus block 0 contains element 1, block1 contains
 the smallest element not in block 0, and so on. A Restricted Growth
 string (or RG string) is a sring a[1..n] where a[i] is the block in
 which element i occurs. Restricted Growth strings are often called
 restricted growth functions. Here are the RG strings corresponding
 to the partitions shown above.

   1 block:  0000
   2 blocks: 0001, 0010, 0100, 0111, 0011, 0101, 0110
   3 blocks: 0122, 0121, 0112, 0120, 0102,
